Log Classification System

Classification Approaches
1. Regular Expression (Regex):
Handles the most simplified and predictable patterns.
Useful for patterns that are easily captured using predefined rules.

2. Sentence Transformer + Logistic Regression:
Manages complex patterns when there is sufficient training data.
Utilizes embeddings generated by Sentence Transformers and applies Logistic Regression as the classification layer.

3. LLM (Large Language Models):
Used for handling complex patterns when sufficient labeled training data is not available.
Provides a fallback or complementary approach to the other methods.
